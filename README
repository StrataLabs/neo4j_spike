1) In case you see this error while doing a 'bundle install': 

System.java:-2:in `arraycopy': java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	from DefaultResolver.java:111:in `makeTime'
	
make sure that you add this line to your shell's profile:
export JRUBY_OPTS="--1.9"

(This enables JRuby to work in Ruby 1.9 mode)

2) You'll need to use Neo4j version 1.1.4. This fixes an issue with a dependency on the will_paginate gem.
